Standard RAxML version 7.3.1

Compiling under Linux:

standard, SSE3 or AVX version?

In general you should try to compile the SSE3 version that makes use of capabilities 
on relativiely recent processors (most Intel or AMD chips not older than 3-4 years).
The SSE3 version will run about 40% faster than the non-SSE3 version.

If you have a more recently bought processor (within the last 1-2 years), please also try to compile
the AVX version which once again uses the capabilities of modern processors better and can be 10-30% faster 
than the SSE3 version. AVX will work on the Intel i7 (sandy-bridge) series processors as well as on the very recently 
released AMD Bulldozer systems. 

Compiling should work out of the box with all reasonably recent vesrion of the GNU gcc and Intel icc compilers.
If you want to use icc replace gcc by icc in the Makefiles.
